This fixed variant has\na separate capability bit in the MTRR capability MSR.\n\nSo far all x86 CPUs which support MTRR have this separate bit set, so it\nwent unnoticed that mtrr_save_state() does not check the capability bit\nbefore accessing the fixed MTRR MSRs.\n\nThough on a CPU that does not support the fixed MTRR capability this\nresults in a #GP.  The #GP itself is harmless because the RDMSR fault is\nhandled gracefully, but results in a WARN_ON().\n\nAdd the missing capability check to prevent this.",
