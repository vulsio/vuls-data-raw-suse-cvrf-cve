A command injection vulnerability in the Web SSH feature allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the host.

An attacker can exploit the username variable to escape from the bash command and inject arbitrary commands into sshCommand. This is possible, because, unlike hostname and port, the username is not validated or sanitized.",
