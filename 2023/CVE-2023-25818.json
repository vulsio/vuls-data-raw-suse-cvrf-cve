In affected versions a malicious user could try to reset the password of another user and then brute force the 62^21 combinations for the password reset token.

None the less it is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
