A path traversal and arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in versions of Atril prior to 1.26.2.

The only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited to overwrite existing files, but that doesn't stop an attacker from achieving Remote Command Execution on the target system. Version 1.26.2 of Atril contains a patch for this vulnerability.",
