Executing the argument function synchronously from within\ndpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may\ncause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a\nrequisite supplier device's one, for example).\n\nAddress this by changing the code in question to use\nasync_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous\nexecution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly\nrun them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.",
